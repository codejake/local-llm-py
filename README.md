# README

Various scripts to interact with local LLMs running on my devices. More soon. Maybe.

`hello2.py` is a much more fleshed-out example, so just look at that.

So far, all the stuff in here uses [MLX](https://opensource.apple.com/projects/mlx/) 
and mlx-llm](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx), so they require an Apple 
Silicon device. I am open to GTX 4090 donations, however.
